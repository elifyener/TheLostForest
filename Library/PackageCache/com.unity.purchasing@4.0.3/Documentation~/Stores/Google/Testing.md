# Testing

Before publishing your application you must test your in-app purchases on an Android device as an alpha or beta distribution.

Note that while your Alpha or Beta APK must be published to test your IAPs, this does not mean your App has to be publicly visible in the Google Play store.

In order to perform a complete end-to-end test of your in-app purchases, you must do so while signed into a device using a test account.

Please note the following:

* You must upload a signed, release version of your APK to Google Play that is published as an alpha or beta distribution.
* The version number of the APK that you upload must match the version number of the APK that you test with.
* After entering your purchase metadata into the Google Play publisher console. It may take up to 24 hours before the purchase metadata that you entered into the Google Play publisher console will be activated. At that point, you can use your test account to make in-app purchases.
